# 343-HW1
Github won't allow me up upload a screenshot right now and it keeps saying error so I added this google drive link with my last git hub command to show you I have been working on creating branches and pulls on the 'kyle.txt' https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kH0lCFqbhfRIh1OrcOVQlu4qETOvArT5/view?usp=sharing
- I also emailed you with more information, thank you!
## Common git commands I will use:
- git add: will add work to staging area
- branch: will allow you to use multiple different versions of a file
- clone: creates a copy of a git repository
- commit: takes staged files and commits it to the project history
- fetch: gets a branch from a another repository
- init: initializes a new git repository
- push: moves local files to repository 
- status: displays the state of the working dipository
